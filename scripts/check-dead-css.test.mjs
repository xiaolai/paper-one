/**
 * `check-dead-css`: what counts as reaching a class, and what does not.
 *
 * THE GATE EXISTS BECAUSE A RULE OUTLIVES ITS COMPONENT SILENTLY — `.enriching`,
 * `.emptyAction` and `.popover` were all found by hand, and by the third it was
 * a class of defect rather than three mistakes. What makes a check like that
 * worth having is that it is neither blind nor noisy, and both halves are here:
 * a rule nothing can reach is reported, and every way a class IS reached is
 * proved not to trip it. A false positive is the failure that matters more,
 * because it is the one that teaches people to ignore the gate.
